# About Me

I am Ji Guan, an **[Associate Professor](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~guanji)** at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2014, I received my bachelor’s degree in [computational mathematics](http://math.scu.edu.cn/English.htm) from [Sichuan University](http://en.scu.edu.cn), China, and then obtained my Ph.D. degree in [quantum computing](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/centre-quantum-software-and-information) supervised by [Prof. Mingsheng Ying](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/mingsheng.ying) and [Prof. Yuan Feng](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1312/4483.htm) from [Centre for Quantum Software and Information](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/centre-quantum-software-and-information) of [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au), Australia in 2018. 

My research focus on systematically addressing the **security, privacy, and reliability of quantum algorithm, program, and hardware systems** by developing **formal method (verification) theories, algorithms, and tools**. By extending **formal methods** — a branch of computer science celebrated with multiple **Turing Awards** — to the quantum domain, I ensure that quantum systems operate reliably, securely, and efficiently.

My research has been widely recognized for its foundational contributions to quantum computing and formal methods. I have published nearly 20 papers in internationally renowned venues, including **CAV, ACM CCS, SIAM Journal on Computing, IEEE TIT** and **FM**. As a principal investigator, I have secured six competitive research grants from the **National Natural Science Foundation of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),** and **Beijing City**. These achievements earned me accolades such as the **Beijing High-Level Overseas Talent Program award, Youth Innovation Promotion Association Membership (CAS),** and the **CAS Outstanding Youth Award**. Additionally, I have been invited to serve as a **Program Committee Member** for prestigious conferences, including **[CAV 2025](https://conferences.i-cav.org/2025/) (only two scholars in Mainland China)** and **[QCNC 2025](https://ieee-qcnc.org)**.

## **Research Focus**

In the **Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)** era, quantum systems face unprecedented challenges arising from their inherent state complexity (e.g., quantum superposition and entanglement), noise unpredictability, and measurement uncertainties. My research systematically addresses these critical issues by developing **formal method theories, algorithms, and tools** to ensure that quantum systems operate **reliably**, **securely**, and **efficiently**.

By extending **formal methods** — a branch of computer science celebrated with multiple Turing Awards — to the quantum domain, I bridge the gap between quantum theory and real-world applications, providing a foundation for **trustworthy quantum systems**. Specifically, my contributions are organized into three interconnected areas: **quantum system correctness, robust and privacy-preserving quantum algorithms**, and **quantum-accelerated formal verification**, culminating in the development of **[VeriQ](https://www.veri-q.com)**, the world’s first comprehensive toolchain for trustworthy quantum computing.

## **Research Contributions**

### **1. Correctness of Quantum Systems**
Ensuring the correctness of quantum systems (protocols, algorithms, programs) is fundamental but complex due to the continuous nature of quantum states. My key contributions include:
- Introducing **Quantum Markov Chains** as a formal model for quantum system evolution.
- Developing **3-level decomposition techniques** (coherence, irreducibility, periodicity) for analyzing **reachability problems**.
- Proposing **quantum temporal logics** to specify dynamic correctness properties.
- Designing automated **model-checking algorithms** for system verification.

**Applications**: Validated quantum communication protocols and quantum algorithms.

### **2. Robust and Privacy-Preserving Quantum Algorithms**
Quantum machine learning algorithms are highly susceptible to noise and privacy risks. I developed a formal framework to define and verify:
- **Local robustness**, **global robustness**, and **differential privacy** for quantum algorithms.
- Designed quantum (machine learning) algorithm models that are both **noise-resistant** and **privacy-preserving**.

**Key Publications**: *CAV 2021, 2022*, *ACM CCS 2023*  

*These works were recognized as the "first step in the field" and were included in the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) quantum security report.*

### **3. Quantum-Accelerated Formal Verification**
To address the computational limitations of classical verification methods, I developed:
- **Polynomial-time quantum algorithms** for fidelity estimation using techniques like **block encoding** and **quantum amplitude estimation**.
- Algorithms to compute key quantum information metrics: **trace distance** and **entropy**.
- The **first quantum algorithm** for solving reachability problems in quantum systems, achieving **exponential speedup**.

**Key Publications**: *IEEE TIT 2023, 2024*, *QIC 2021*
