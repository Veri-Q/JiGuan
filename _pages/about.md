# About Me

I am Ji Guan, an **[Associate Professor](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~guanji)** at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2014, I received my bachelor’s degree in [computational mathematics](http://math.scu.edu.cn/English.htm) from [Sichuan University](http://en.scu.edu.cn), China, and then obtained my Ph.D. degree in [quantum computing](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/centre-quantum-software-and-information) supervised by [Prof. Mingsheng Ying](https://www.uts.edu.au/staff/mingsheng.ying) and [Prof. Yuan Feng](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/info/1312/4483.htm) from [Centre for Quantum Software and Information](https://www.uts.edu.au/research-and-teaching/our-research/centre-quantum-software-and-information) of [University of Technology Sydney](https://www.uts.edu.au), Australia in 2018. 

My research focus on systematically addressing the **security, privacy, and reliability of quantum algorithm, program, and hardware systems** by developing **formal method (verification) theories, algorithms, and tools**. By extending **formal methods** — a branch of computer science celebrated with multiple **Turing Awards** — to the quantum domain, I ensure that quantum systems operate reliably, securely, and efficiently.

My research has been widely recognized for its foundational contributions to quantum computing and formal methods. I have published nearly 20 papers in internationally renowned venues, including **CAV, ACM CCS, SIAM Journal on Computing, IEEE TIT** and **FM**. As a principal investigator, I have secured six competitive research grants from the **National Natural Science Foundation of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),** and **Beijing City**. These achievements earned me accolades such as the **Beijing High-Level Overseas Talent Program award, Youth Innovation Promotion Association Membership (CAS),** and the **CAS Outstanding Youth Award**. Additionally, I have been invited to serve as a **Program Committee Member** for prestigious conferences, including **[CAV 2025](https://conferences.i-cav.org/2025/) (only two scholars in Mainland China)** and **[QCNC 2025](https://ieee-qcnc.org)**.
