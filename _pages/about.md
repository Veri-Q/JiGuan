# About Me

I am Ji Guan, an **Associate Research Professor** at the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 2014, I received my bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Sichuan University, China, and then obtained my Ph.D. degree in computer science from University of Technology Sydney, Australia in 2018. My research focus on systematically addressing the **security, privacy, and reliability of quantum algorithm, program, and hardware systems** by developing **formal method (verification) theories, algorithms, and tools**. By extending **formal methods** — a branch of computer science celebrated with multiple **Turing Awards** — to the quantum domain, I ensure that quantum systems operate reliably, securely, and efficiently.
My research has been widely recognized for its foundational contributions to quantum computing and formal methods. I have published nearly 20 papers in internationally renowned venues, including **CAV, ACM CCS, SIAM Journal on Computing, IEEE TIT** and **FM**. As a principal investigator, I have secured six competitive research grants from the **National Natural Science Foundation of China, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS),** and **Beijing City**. These achievements earned me accolades such as the **Beijing High-Level Overseas Talent Program award, Youth Innovation Promotion Association Membership (CAS),** and the **CAS Outstanding Youth Award**. Additionally, I have been invited to serve as a **Program Committee Member** for prestigious conferences, including **CAV 2025 (only two scholars in Mainland China)** and **QCNC 2025**.

## **Research Focus**
In the **Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)** era, quantum systems face unprecedented challenges arising from their inherent state complexity (e.g., quantum superposition and entanglement), noise unpredictability, and measurement uncertainties. My research systematically addresses these critical issues by developing **formal method theories, algorithms, and tools** to ensure that quantum systems operate **reliably**, **securely**, and **efficiently**.

By extending **formal methods** — a branch of computer science celebrated with multiple Turing Awards — to the quantum domain, I bridge the gap between quantum theory and real-world applications, providing a foundation for **trustworthy quantum systems**. Specifically, my contributions are organized into three interconnected areas: **quantum system correctness, robust and privacy-preserving quantum algorithms**, and **quantum-accelerated formal verification**, culminating in the development of **VeriQ**, the world’s first comprehensive toolchain for trustworthy quantum computing.

## **Research Contributions**

### **1. Correctness of Quantum Systems**
Ensuring the correctness of quantum systems (protocols, algorithms, programs) is fundamental but complex due to the continuous nature of quantum states. My key contributions include:
- Introducing **Quantum Markov Chains** as a formal model for quantum system evolution.
- Developing **3-level decomposition techniques** (coherence, irreducibility, periodicity) for analyzing **reachability problems**.
- Proposing **quantum temporal logics** to specify dynamic correctness properties.
- Designing automated **model-checking algorithms** for system verification.

**Applications**: Validated quantum communication protocols and quantum algorithms.  

**Key Publications**:  *CAV 2024*,*SIAM Journal on Computing 2021*,*CONCUR 2021*,*TACAS 2022*,*ITCS 2020*,*QIC 2018*,*JCSS 2018*.  

*These results are featured prominently in the monograph* **Model Checking Quantum Systems: Principles and Algorithms** *(Cambridge University Press).*

### **2. Robust and Privacy-Preserving Quantum Algorithms**
Quantum machine learning algorithms are highly susceptible to noise and privacy risks. I developed a formal framework to define and verify:
- **Local robustness**, **global robustness**, and **differential privacy** for quantum algorithms.
- Designed quantum (machine learning) algorithm models that are both **noise-resistant** and **privacy-preserving**.

**Key Publications**: *CAV 2021, 2022*, *ACM CCS 2023*  

*These works were recognized as the "first step in the field" and were included in the German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) quantum security report.*

### **3. Quantum-Accelerated Formal Verification**
To address the computational limitations of classical verification methods, I developed:
- **Polynomial-time quantum algorithms** for fidelity estimation using techniques like **block encoding** and **quantum amplitude estimation**.
- Algorithms to compute key quantum information metrics: **trace distance** and **entropy**.
- The **first quantum algorithm** for solving reachability problems in quantum systems, achieving **exponential speedup**.

**Key Publications**: *IEEE TIT 2023, 2024*, *QIC 2021*

### **4. VeriQ Toolchain: Trustworthy Quantum Computing**
I co-led the development of **VeriQ**, the first comprehensive toolchain for trustworthy quantum computing. VeriQ offers:
- **Quantum Design Automation (QDA)** for quantum chip optimization.
- **Quantum Program Verification and Analysis** to ensure algorithm correctness.
- **Trustworthy Quantum Machine Learning** for robustness and privacy assessment.

**Achievements**:  
- **Key Publications**:  **FM 2024** and **DATE 2024**.
- Released **10 tools**, successfully deployed on **Zuchongzhi 2.0** superconducting quantum processor.  
- **3 national invention patents** secured.

1. **Quantum Algorithms on NISQ Devices**  
   - Optimize and implement quantum machine learning algorithms for applications like:  
     - High-dimensional data classification  
     - Quantum state discrimination  
     - Entanglement detection  
   - Validate experimentally on real quantum hardware to demonstrate **quantum advantage**.

2. **Formal Verification Techniques**  
   - Tackle key problems such as **termination analysis** and **automatic invariant generation** to ensure program correctness and reliability.

3. **Quantum Circuit Optimization**  
   - Develop tools for transpilation, synthesis, and optimization of dynamic quantum circuits:  
     - **Circuit depth reduction**  
     - **Noise mitigation**  
     - **Hardware-specific optimization**

These efforts will further enhance the **VeriQ** toolchain, transforming it into a leading platform for **end-to-end trustworthy quantum computing** and bridging the gap between theoretical advancements and practical quantum systems.
